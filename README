Please note that Linaro compiler toolchain, by default:
- uses unaligned memory access
- marks as abortive the declaration of variables not *REALLY* used

To avoid errors and malfunctions it's then necessary modify the makefiles in this way:

- to add   -mno-unaligned-access   to KBUILD_CFLAGS
- remove the    -Werror            in KBUILD_CFLAGS
